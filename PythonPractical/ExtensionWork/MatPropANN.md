# Material Property prediction using artificial neural networks

## Aim

Predict bandgap of composite materials from the properties of individual elements.

## Background

1. install magpy 

   pip install git+https://github.com/alphaleegroup/magpy.git

   





### Approach

We have initial source data that is material information for individual elements. 



There are many ways to embed this data  - convert it into a shorter vector of numbers. The values do not have direct physical meaning.
